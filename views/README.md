## Documentation

This site is an *incomplete draft* of the documentation for Administrate.
Its purpose is to collect feedback from developers
on the API before a lot of time is spent in development.

Note: *None of the library has been implemented yet*,
so it will be very easy to incorporate any suggestions you make.
Please leave feedback through the link at the top!
