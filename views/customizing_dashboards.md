# Customizing Dashboards

In order to customize which attributes get displayed for each resource,
edit the dashboard file generated by the installation generator.

By default, the file will look something like this:

```ruby
require "administrate/dashboard/base"

class CustomerDashboard < Administrate::Dashboard::Base

  def attribute_types
    {
      id: :integer,
      name: :string,
      email: :email,
      created_at: :datetime,
      updated_at: :datetime,
      orders: :has_many,
    }
  end

  def index_page_attributes
    [
      :id,
      :name,
      :email,
      :created_at,
      :updated_at,
      :orders,
    ]
  end

  def show_page_attributes
    [
      :id,
      :name,
      :email,
      :created_at,
      :updated_at,
      :orders,
    ]
  end

  def form_attributes
    [
      :name,
      :email,
      :orders,
    ]
  end
end
```

To change which attributes appear on each of the `index`, `show`, and `edit`
pages, add or remove attributes to the arrays returned from each method.

Finally, the `attribute_types` method defines how each attribute is displayed
throughout the dashboard. There are a number of recognized symbols that you can
provide, including:

- `belongs_to`
- `datetime`
- `float`
- `has_many`
- `integer`
- `string`

Change attribute types until you find the best combination,
or [define your own] for unusual data types.
